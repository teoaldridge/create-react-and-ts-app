This is an exercise to create a Ract and TypeScript app without using create-react-app

I followed this tutorial: 

Setting up React + TypeScript + webpack app from scratch without create-react-app
https://dev.to/alekseiberezkin/setting-up-react-typescript-app-without-create-react-app-oph


To run the dev server, from the root directory run: 

```
npm start
```

To build the app for production, from the root directory run: 

```
npm run build
```

To serve the dist folder with bundle files as in real production:
```
npx serve dist
```

To check for linting errors: 
```
npm run lint
```

To resolve linting errors automatically: 
```
npm run lint:fix
```
